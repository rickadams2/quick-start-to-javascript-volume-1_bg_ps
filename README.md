# quick-start-to-javascript-volume-1_bg_ps

This tutorial assumes no prior programming experience and starts exploring the logic of the JavaScript language and the concepts needed to write code from the ground up. We'll start by exploring what we can create with JavaScript and then learn how to start creating our own code with the basic building blocks of JavaScript using strings, numbers, booleans, common operators, variables, and control flow. 
We'll finish the JavaScript training by putting together all the concepts with the creation of a simple zombie text adventure game.
While building a project together, you'll be provided with valuable knowledge, and the real power comes from being able to take the techniques you've learned and apply them in a different way to your own work.
